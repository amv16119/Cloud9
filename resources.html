		<h3>Medical Marijuana</h3>
		<p> Marijuana is a drug from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. Even though many people use the word “marijuana” when referencing cannabis, the term “marijuana” specifically references the dried flowers and leaves of the cannabis plant. <br>Least controversial is the extract from the hemp plant known as CBD (which stands for cannabidiol) because this component of marijuana has little, if any, intoxicating properties. Marijuana itself has more than 100 active components. THC (which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol) is the chemical that causes the "high" that goes along with marijuana consumption. CBD-dominant strains have little or no THC, so patients report very little if any alteration in consciousness. </p>

		<h3>Marijuana Without the High</h3>
		<p>Medical marijuana, also known as medical cannabis, is used to treat a variety of symptoms including nausea, pain, muscle stiffness, muscle spasticity and loss of appetite. In some states, laws have been passed that allow doctors to certify individuals with certain serious medical conditions to obtain medical marijuana from a state-licensed dispensary. It may be dispensed to those who have conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, seizures, neurological diseases and HIV/AIDS. <br>Patients report many benefits of CBD, from relieving insomnia, anxiety, spasticity, and pain to treating potentially life-threatening conditions such as epilepsy. One particular form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet syndrome is almost impossible to control but responds dramatically to a CBD-dominant strain of marijuana called Charlotte’s Web.</p>
